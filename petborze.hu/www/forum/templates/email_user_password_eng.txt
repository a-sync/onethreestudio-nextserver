SUBJECT>>{$sitename}: New password instructions<<
Hello {$loginName},

here goes your new password for the site "{$sitename}":

{$newPasswd}

Why new? We store passwords in encrypted format, so ONLY YOU know it. If you have forgotten your password, we can not restore it, we can only change it.

Click the confirmation link below to activate your new password:

{$main_url}/{$indexphp}action=confirmpasswd&confirmCode={$confirmCode}

Click on it (or copy/paste in your browser), and your password will be automatically changed to the NEW PASSWORD listed above. Until you click the activation link, nothing will be changed.

Once you are logged in with your new password, you can change your password anytime to something easier for you to remember.
Click "{$l_menu[5]}" link near the top of the webpage to change your password, and possibly other forums preferences.

Best Regards,
Forum Administrator
